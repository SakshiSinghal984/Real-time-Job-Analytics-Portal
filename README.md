# Real-time-Job-Analytics-Portal
It is an real-time Job Analytics Portal that shows different charts based on different parameters to help job seekers gain knowledge about job market.
For this, I have created a website that contains all the visualizations and charts  according to the conditions or tasks given.
For the Dataset, I have downloaded it from Kaggle named "jobs_descriptions".
